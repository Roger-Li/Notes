### 2.5 Nonparametric Methods
* Limitations of parametric model: (pp. 120) For instance, the process that generates the data is multimodal, then this aspect of the distribution can never be captured by a Gaussian, which is necessarily unimodal.

#### 2.5.1 Kernel density estimators
* two contradictory assumptions of (2.246, $p(\mathbf{x} = \frac{K}{NV})$), namely that the region $\mathcal{R}$ be sufficiently small that the density is approximately constant over the region and yet sufficiently large in relation to the value of that density that the number $K$ of points falling inside the region is sufficent for the binomial distribution to be sharply peaked.
* (2.246) fix $K$ and determine $V$ from the data gives rise to $K$- nearest-neighbour, fix $V$ determine $K$ from the data gives rise to the kernel methods.
#### 2.5.2 Nearest-neighbour methods
* (pp. 125) derivation of KNN classifier using Bayes rule and KNN density estimator.
